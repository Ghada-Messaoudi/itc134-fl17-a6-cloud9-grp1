    <h2>Linux File Management</h2>
    <h3>touch</h3>
    
    <p>The "touch" command will either create a new file with the name you give it or, if a file with that name already exists, it will update a file's datestamp. The file will appear in your current working directory.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt1.PNG" alt="touch file.txt">
    
    <p><code>touch file.txt</code> will create a new text file with the name "my_file.txt".</p>

    <p>To create many files at once you can use the format shown in the example below.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt2.PNG" alt="touch making several files">
    
    <p><code>touch file{1.txt,2.txt,3.txt}</code> will create three new files named "file1.txt","file2.txt" and "file3.txt".</p>
    
    <h3>mkdir</h3>
    
    <p>The "mkdir" command creates new directories, also known as folders.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt3.PNG" alt="mkdir making a new folder">
    
    <p><code>mkdir myFolder</code> creates the directory "myFolder" in the current working directory. To create nested directories use the "-p" option to create parent directories if they don't exist already, as shown below.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt4.PNG" alt="mkdir making a nested folder">
    
    <p><code>mkdir myFolder/innerFolder/innermostFolder</code> will create a directory called "innermostFolder" inside "innerFolder" that will itself be inside "myFolder" even if "myFolder" and "innerFolder" don't exist yet.</p>
    
    <h3>ls</h3>
    
    <p>The "ls" command will show you the contents of a directory. By default (without any arguments or options passed to it) it will show all non-hidden files and directories (files with names that don't start with a "." prefix)</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt5.PNG" alt="ls">
    
    <p><code>ls</code> will by default show only the file and directory names. Directories end with a "/"</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt6.PNG" alt="directory contents">

    <p>The "-l" option will list the contents in long form, showing file permissions, author, size, and time last modified.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt7.PNG" alt="ls -la">

    <p><code>ls -la</code> will also, with the "-a" (all) option, reveal the hidden files that start with ".", including the parent directory of the current directory, which is represented by "../"</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt8.PNG" alt="directory contents in long form">
    
    <h3>cp</h3>
    
    <p>The "cp" command copies files, either to a different location or with a new name, or both.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt9.PNG" alt="copying a file to a new location">
    
    <p><code>cp file.txt myFolder/newFileName.txt</code> will copy the contents of "file.txt" and put them in a file named "newFileName.txt" in the folder "myFolder/"</p>
    
    <p>The "-r" (recursive) option allows copying of directories and their contents.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt10.PNG" alt="copying a directory">
    
    <p><code>cp -r myFolder/ destination/</code> will either copy the directory "myFolder" into the directory "destination", if it exists, or place the copy into the current working directory with the name "destination" if it doesn't already exist.</p>
    
    <p>Using the wildcard character "*" and a file extension allows you to copy all files of a particular type.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt11.PNG" alt="copying all plain text files in a directory">
    
    <p><code>cp *.txt destination/</code></p> will copy all plain text files (with the .txt file extension) to the folder "destination"
    
    <h3>mv</h3>
    
    <p>The "mv" command moves files and/or renames them.</p>
