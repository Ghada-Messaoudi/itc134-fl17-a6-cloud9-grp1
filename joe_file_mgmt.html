    <h3>touch</h3>
    
    <p>The "touch" command will either create a new file with the name you give it or, if a file with that name already exists, it will update a file's datestamp. The file will appear in your current working directory.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt1.PNG" alt="touch making a new file">
    
    <p>The above command will create a new text file with the name "my_file.txt".</p>

    <p>To create many files at once you can use the format shown in the example below.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt2.PNG" alt="touch making several files">
    
    <p>The above command will create three new files named "file1.txt","file2.txt" and "file3.txt".</p>
    
    <h3>mkdir</h3>
    
    <p>The "mkdir" command creates new directories, also known as folders.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt3.PNG" alt="mkdir making a new folder">
    
    <p>The above command creates the directory "myFolder" in the current working directory. To create nested directories use the "-p" option to create parent directories if they don't exist already, as shown below.</p>
    
    <img src="images/fileMgmt4.PNG" alt="mkdir making a nested folder">
    
    <p>The above command will create a directory called "innermostFolder" inside "innerFolder" that will itself be inside "myFolder" even if "myFolder" and "innerFolder" don't exist yet.</p>
    
    <h3>ls</h3>
    
    <p>The "ls" command will show you the contents of a directory. By default (without any arguments or options passed to it) it will show non-hidden files (files with names that don't have a "." prefix)</p>
